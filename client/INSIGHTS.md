# INSIGHTS — client
Lessons learned while working in this package (by humans or agents).
Maintained via the engineering-insights skill (.claude/skills/engineering-insights) — read it
before work, add only verified non-obvious lessons after. Newest first within a section.
Keep each entry ≤5 lines. Agents only append; changing, moving to CLAUDE.md or deleting existing entries needs the user's OK.

## What Works
<!-- Approaches that proved themselves, ideally after an alternative failed -->

## What Doesn't Work
<!-- Failed approaches / anti-patterns, with the reason -->

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Non-obvious conventions or decisions with rationale, not already in CLAUDE.md -->

### 2026-09-22 — a popover inside the PR-list table must be portalled to <body>
- What: `s.tableCard` sets `overflow: "hidden"` for its rounded corners, so any panel rendered inside a row is clipped at the table edge; the kit `Dropdown` hits the same wall (it is `position: absolute` and click-triggered).
- Why: verified in Chrome — the portalled card paints at y≈12 while the table starts at y≈160, which a descendant of an `overflow: hidden` box cannot do.
- Rule: `createPortal(node, document.body)` + `position: fixed` from `getBoundingClientRect()`, and close on scroll/resize — see toast.tsx / kit/Drawer.tsx for the same pattern.
- Evidence: src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/FindingsCell/FindingsHoverCard.tsx:46 · src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/styles.ts:108

## Tool & Library Notes
<!-- Quirks of dependencies and tools -->

### 2026-09-22 — "close on scroll" closes a popover when you scroll the popover
- What: `window.addEventListener("scroll", close, true)` fired for the hover card's OWN scrollable body, so scrolling the findings list shut it mid-read.
- Why: `scroll` doesn't bubble, so the listener must be capture-phase — and capture runs window→target for EVERY scroll, including inside the popover.
- Rule: in that handler, bail when `cardRef.current?.contains(e.target)`; only a scroll outside the popover should dismiss it.
- Evidence: src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/FindingsCell/FindingsCell.tsx:100 · FindingsCell.test.tsx:210 "stays open while its own findings list is scrolled"

### 2026-09-22 — `useRouter: () => ({ push: vi.fn() })` makes navigation unassertable
- What: that next/navigation mock hands out a FRESH spy per `useRouter()` call, so `expect(push).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)` always sees 0 calls — the test can only prove a click didn't throw.
- Why: the factory runs per call, not per module; the spy the test holds is never the one the component used.
- Rule: hoist one stable spy — `const push = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn())` + `beforeEach(push.mockClear)` — whenever a test asserts where a click navigates.
- Evidence: src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/PRRow/PRRow.test.tsx:16 (hoisted spy; "click reaches the row")
